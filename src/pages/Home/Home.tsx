            <p className="hook_explain">
              React Hooks are tools that allow you to use state and other React
              features without writing class components. They're designed to
              simplify your code and make it easier to share logic across
              components.
            </p>
            <p className="rule_hooks">
              There are 3 rules for hooks: <br />
              Hooks can only be called inside React function components. <br />
              Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component. <br />
              Hooks cannot be conditional.

                <h2>Benefits</h2>
                <span>Reuse States and Components:</span> React Hooks enable the reuse of
                stateful logic without the need for complex patterns like
                higher-order components or render props. This makes components
                more modular and easier to maintain. <br />
                <span>Better Code Composition:</span> Hooks allow for separating logic into
                smaller, reusable functions. This results in cleaner, more
                organized code thatâ€™s easier to read and extend. <br />
                <span>Performance:</span> Hooks help reduce unnecessary re-renders by
                optimizing state and effect dependencies. They offer better
                control over when and how components update, improving overall
                application performance. <br />
                <span>Better Testing:</span> With React Hooks, logic is moved into isolated
                functions, which can be tested independently. This improves the
                testability of components and ensures more reliable outcomes.

            <p>
              <span>JavaScript and More</span> <br />
              TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a
              tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your
              editor.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>A Result You Can Trust </span><br />
              TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere
              JavaScript runs: In a browser, on Node.js, Deno, Bun and in your
              apps.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span>Safety at Scale</span> <br />
              TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give
              you great tooling without additional code.
